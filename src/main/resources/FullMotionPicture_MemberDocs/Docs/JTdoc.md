# Joey Thomas's Perspective
#### Date: October 31, 2025

### How it went
I would consider this experience in particular to be the most structured yet, in terms of Git workflow at the very least.
We made use of many GitHub features that until now we'd simply ignored because we did not understand them, but now that we do it has made our work much more organized.
This allowed for us to easily know who was working on what, what was left to be done, and added a sense of security in the safety net that is branch protection rules.

### What was good
With the upgraded Git workflow in place, everything moved along much more smoothly.
I especially liked the challenge of reviewing each others code for the pull requests.

### what was bad
While our efficiency has no doubt increased, the fact remains that these features are still new to us.
Time was spent on solving quirks and errors the likes of which we have not seen before. Not much time, mind you, but time nonetheless.

### what can be improved
The obvious solution to the problem mentioned above is experience. As much as I would like to offload the blame onto GitHub's developers, 
I cannot do so in good conscience. Thus, the ideal solution is still experience. Which thankfully, this Sprint has provided much of.
