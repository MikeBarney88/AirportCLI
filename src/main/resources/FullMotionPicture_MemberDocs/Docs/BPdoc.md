### How it went
Overall it went well, the assignment was fun and I learned alot
### What was good
I found the assignment as a whole was good, it helped me learn/figure out alot
because where I had missed quite a bit of time due to being in the hospital
### what was bad
alot of issues/hiccups with tests, and getting them to merge through GitHub
and some long google sessions
### what can be improved
I could/should practice more on writing the tests specifically
I struggle quite a bit on those.
