Overall it went well, the assignment was fun and i learned alot
### What was good
i found the assignment as a whole was good, it helped me learn/figure out alot
because where i had missed quite abit of time due to being in the hospital
### what was bad
alot of issues/hiccups with tests, and getting them to merge through github
and some long google sessions
### what can be improved
i could/should practice more on writing the tests specifically
i struggle quite abit on those.
